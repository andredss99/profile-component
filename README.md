# DevChallenge
## Profile Component

This is a simple project developed in HTML and CSS inspired by one of the many exercises (and my first) from [DevChallenge](https://devchallenge.now.sh/) site. It helps us to improve our skills in front-end and back-and using a variety of technologies, like HTML, CSS, JS, React Native and others from the developer's prefence.

- [X] Web version
